So I've been thinking about how we organize content in knowledge bases, right? Like, there's always this tension between having a strict hierarchy and letting things be more organic and interconnected. I mean, hierarchies are great for navigation - people understand folders and categories - but real knowledge doesn't work like that. It's more like a network or a web where everything connects to everything else.

I guess what I'm realizing is that you need both. You need the hierarchy for the initial navigation, for people who are just landing on your site and need to find something. But then once they're reading a document, you want all these cross-links that let them explore related concepts. It's like, the hierarchy is the map, but the links are the actual territory.

And tags! Tags are interesting because they're kind of a middle ground. They give you this lightweight categorization without forcing everything into rigid boxes. But you have to be disciplined about them or they become useless. Too many tags and it's just noise. Too few and you lose the benefit.

Oh, and one more thing - I think the landing zone concept we're using for brain dumps is actually a perfect example of this. Like, we have a clear hierarchy (brain-dumps → staging → docs) but the content itself can be linked across all three layers. The structure provides organization but doesn't constrain the connections.
